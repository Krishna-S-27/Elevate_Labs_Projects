Utilized the publicly available King County, USA dataset from Kaggle for model training and evaluation. Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization to understand feature correlations and trends. Applied and compared multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest. Achieved high prediction accuracy and visualized model performance through error metrics and plots.""}, {""name"": ""Design and Implementation of Brain Tumor Detection and Classification using MRI Images with Quantum Machine Learning"", ""techStack"": [""Python"", ""Streamlit"", ""Scikit-learn"", ""PennyLane""], ""role"": ""Team Leader and Lead Developer (ML & QML)"", ""description"": ""Developed a hybrid system combining Traditional Machine Learning ( SVM, CNN, Random Forest) and Quantum Machine Learning (VQC, QCNN, QNN) models for brain tumor classification using MRI images. Led a 4 -member team for a university -assessed Mini Project, handling both classical and quantum algorithm implementation. Achieved 96% accuracy with CNN and 91% with Random Forest in the classical approach and QCNN achieved ~59% as part of ongoing QML experimentation. Authored a research analysis paper on model comparison and performance.""}, {""name"": ""DISCRETA \u2013 Departmental Collaborative Project on Discrete Mathematics"", ""techStack"": [""Python"", ""HTML"", ""CSS"", ""JavaScript""], ""role"": ""Logic Designer and Frontend Developer"", ""description"": ""Collaborated with peers as part of a departmental initiative to create educational games based on discrete mathematics concepts.
